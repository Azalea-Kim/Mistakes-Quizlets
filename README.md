# Mistakes-Quizlets
In general, my app consists of two main functionalities text recognition and quizlets.
Briefly explaining, the user could first upload an image with the mistaken quiz (in this
app it is restricted to MCQs) then the text in the image would be recognized into the
EditText view using BAIDU OCR and the user could slightly modify the content if they want. After that
the user would be asked to select or create a new category for this quiz and the text
would be generated into a quiz in a certain category. Then the user could access
different categories of quizlets and retake the MCQs.
